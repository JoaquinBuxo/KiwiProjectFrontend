# Frontend T9 (Phonewords)

React project with Phone keyboard-like UI, where the backend provides an endpoint that converts a given numeric string into a list of corresponding words in the style of T9 or Phonewords.

For example, given the input “23” the output should be: ad, ae, af, bd, be, bf, cd, ce,
cf.
